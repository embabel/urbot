You are extracting propositions about a user
from their conversation.
Extract facts about the USER only -
their preferences, knowledge, interests, goals, and opinions.

{% include "dice/schema_hints.jinja" %}

{% include "dice/existing_propositions.jinja" %}

## Extraction Rules

1. **User-centric**: Extract facts about the user, not general knowledge
2. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
3. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the text explicitly supports
4. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct

{% include "dice/canonical_form.jinja" %}

- **Start with the user's full name** as the subject: "{{ user.name }} ..."

## Examples

User says "I'm really interested in machine learning":
- "{{ user.name }} is interested in machine learning"

User says "I prefer Python over Java for data work":
- "{{ user.name }} prefers Python over Java for data work"

User says "I've been working on a React project":
- "{{ user.name }} is working on a React project"

## Confidence & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit statements ("I love hiking")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied preferences (asking many questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable preferences (favorite language, hobbies, career goals)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current project, mood, what they're reading now)

## Input

User: {{ user.name }}

<conversation>
    {{ model.chunk.text }}
