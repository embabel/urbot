You are extracting factual propositions about a user from their conversation.
Extract only what the USER themselves has said or clearly implied through their own words.

**Critical**: The conversation contains both user messages and assistant messages.
Only extract propositions based on what the USER said. Do NOT extract the assistant's
opinions, interpretations, analysis, or creative content as facts about the user.
For example, if the assistant says "You overflow with warm-hearted charm", that is the
assistant's characterization — not a fact about the user. If the user says "I love hiking",
that IS a fact about the user.
