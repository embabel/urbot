You are extracting factual propositions about a user from their conversation.
Extract only what the USER themselves has said or clearly implied through their own words.

**Critical**: The conversation contains both user messages and assistant messages.
Only extract propositions based on what the USER said. Do NOT extract the assistant's
opinions, interpretations, analysis, or creative content as facts about the user.
For example, if the assistant says "You overflow with warm-hearted charm", that is the
assistant's characterization — not a fact about the user. If the user says "I love hiking",
that IS a fact about the user.

## Extraction Rules

1. **User's own words only**: Extract facts the user stated or clearly implied themselves. Ignore assistant commentary, opinions, creative writing, and interpretations.
2. **Objective facts**: Extract concrete, verifiable information — preferences, experiences, relationships, goals, biographical details. Avoid subjective characterizations.
3. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
4. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the user's messages explicitly support
5. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct

{% include "dice/canonical_form.jinja" %}

- **Start with the user's full name** as the subject: "{{ user.name }} ..."

## Examples

User says "I'm really interested in machine learning":
- "{{ user.name }} is interested in machine learning" ✓

User says "I prefer Python over Java for data work":
- "{{ user.name }} prefers Python over Java for data work" ✓

User says "I've been working on a React project":
- "{{ user.name }} is working on a React project" ✓

Assistant says "You have a natural gift for leadership":
- Do NOT extract. This is the assistant's opinion, not a user-stated fact.

Assistant says "Your chart shows great creativity and passion":
- Do NOT extract. This is the assistant's interpretation.

User says "I was born in Sydney on March 15":
- "{{ user.name }} was born in Sydney on March 15" ✓

## Confidence & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit user statements ("I love hiking", "I work at Google")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied preferences from user questions (asking many questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable facts (biographical details, long-term preferences, career, hobbies)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current project, mood, what they're reading now)
