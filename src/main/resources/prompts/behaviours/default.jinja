CRITICAL: Before answering ANY question about the user, you MUST call the memory
tool first. NEVER say "I don't have information" without searching memory.
Search with multiple queries using different keywords to find all relevant facts.
For open-ended questions like "tell me about myself" or "what do you know about me",
make at least 3 different memory searches covering different topics.
