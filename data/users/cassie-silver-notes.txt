Cassie Silver was born on March 15, 1992 at 4:22 AM in Hobart, Tasmania. She's a Pisces sun with a Sagittarius moon and Aquarius rising. She grew up near the Derwent River and spent most of her childhood outdoors — hiking up Mount Wellington with her dad, swimming at Kingston Beach, and stargazing from the backyard with her mum's old binoculars. Her grandmother on her mother's side was Greek and used to read coffee grounds and talk about the planets, which is probably where Cassie first picked up an interest in astrology.

She has a cat called Artemis, a grey tabby she adopted from a shelter in 2019. Artemis is extremely opinionated about food and will only eat one specific brand of tuna pate. Cassie also keeps a small balcony garden — mostly herbs like rosemary and basil, but she's been trying to grow chillies with mixed results.

Cassie loves cooking, especially Greek and Thai food. Her signature dish is a slow-cooked lamb shoulder with lemon and oregano that she makes for friends every winter. She dislikes anything with coriander — she's one of those people who thinks it tastes like soap. She's also not a fan of overly sweet desserts, though she makes an exception for her mum's baklava.

She's a big reader and tends toward literary fiction and magical realism. Her favourite book is The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende. She also loves Ursula Le Guin and has read the entire Earthsea series twice. She tried getting into true crime podcasts because everyone at work listens to them but found them too unsettling and went back to listening to music instead.

Music is important to her. She plays guitar — mostly fingerpicking folk stuff — and listens to a lot of Big Thief, Adrianne Lenker, Joni Mitchell, and Nick Drake. She went through a heavy Elliott Smith phase in her early twenties. She dislikes loud electronic music and finds festivals overwhelming, though she'll go to small gigs at bars and really enjoys live jazz. She saw Esperanza Spalding play in Melbourne in 2023 and says it was one of the best nights of her life.

She's interested in herbalism and has been taking a part-time course on Western herbal medicine. She makes her own tinctures and teas and is fascinated by the overlap between traditional plant medicine and astrological correspondences — like how Mars-ruled plants tend to be warming and stimulating. She keeps a journal where she tracks the moon phases alongside her mood and energy levels.

Cassie has travelled through Southeast Asia — Vietnam and Laos were her favourites. She loved Luang Prabang and talks about going back. She's also spent time in Crete visiting family and wants to do a longer stay on one of the smaller Greek islands someday, maybe Ikaria. She's not interested in the typical tourist trail and prefers places where she can settle in for a while.

She has a close group of friends she's known since university. Her best friend is Priya, who she met in first-year philosophy. They have a tradition of doing a tarot reading together on the solstices. Cassie uses the Rider-Waite deck but has been eyeing the Thoth deck because she wants something more challenging.

She dislikes social media and deleted Instagram a couple of years ago. She still uses Signal to keep in touch with people but prefers meeting in person. She's a morning person and usually up before dawn, which she attributes to her Aquarius rising. She runs three or four times a week along the river and finds it meditative. She's not competitive about it — she just likes being outside before the city wakes up.

She's been single for about a year after ending a long relationship. She's not in a rush to date again and has been enjoying having more time to herself. She's been thinking about getting a second cat but worries Artemis wouldn't tolerate it.
